## Project Background 
The California Community Colleges [Chancellor's Office](https://www.cccco.edu/About-Us/Chancellors-Office) provides comprehensive data on students, faculty, staff, and enrollment trends across all California Community Colleges through its [Data Mart](https://datamart.cccco.edu/datamart.aspx) portal. This publicly available resource offers insights into student demographics, enrollment status (full-time/part-time), student services, faculty assignments, course offerings, and institutional performance metrics. It serves as a valuable tool for researchers, educators, policymakers, and the general public to better understand the dynamics and outcomes of the CCC system. 

This EDA examines academic years 2016 to 2024 to observe enrollment trends over time and assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on California Community Colleges. By analyzing changes before, during, and after the pandemic, the goal is to uncover shifts in student enrollment behavior, demographic patterns, and institutional recovery.
